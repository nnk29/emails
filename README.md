# Automatic Email Sender
Made to reach out to businesses for sponsorship more efficiently, this program takes information (name, email, etc.) entered on a spreadsheet about potential businesses and uses it to send emails based on a given template. It also checks whether emails have already been sent and customizes them based on time sent.

## How It Works 
The program first takes in the link of the google sheet which is specified in the main method, converts it to a csv file, and reads from that file using the read_csv function in the pandas library to convert the contents of the sheet into a dataframe object. Then the program cycles through the rows in the dataframe, checking if an email has been sent to each business or not. If an email has not been sent, the name of the business and email are sent to the function send_email, which uses the email, ssl, and smptplib modules to sign into the sender's email, compose an email, and send it to the correct destination. The time the program is ran is also checked and used to customize the greeting a little bit. 

## Lessons Learned
Building this program demonstrated how automating repetitive tasks like email outreach can drastically improve efficiency. By reducing the time spent on manual emailing, we were able to focus more on identifying quality sponsorship leads and crafting better templates. Leveraging libraries like pandas for data handling and smtplib for email communication also underscored the importance of understanding Python’s ecosystem. Finally, the ability to personalize email templates for each recipient highlighted how small adjustments—like addressing a business by name—can improve engagement rates. This was a key takeaway for making future outreach efforts more impactful.
